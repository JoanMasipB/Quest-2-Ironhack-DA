# Quest-2-Ironhack-DA
## Analysis of Shark Attack Data by Season and Hemisphere
### Introduction
The provided Python code is designed to analyze shark attack data from an Excel file, specifically focusing on the seasonal distribution of attacks based on the hemisphere and the fatality of the incidents. By employing the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, the code extracts relevant information from the dataset, categorizes it, and prepares it for further analysis.

### Key Concepts
The code utilizes several key concepts in data analysis:

**Data Extraction:** The code reads data from an Excel file using Pandas.

**Regular Expressions:** It employs regular expressions to extract specific information from strings, such as months and fatality status.

**Data Grouping:** The code groups data by various categories (hemisphere, month, season) to facilitate analysis.

**Data Visualization:** Although not fully implemented in the provided code, the intention is to visualize the results using Matplotlib.

### Code Structure
The code is structured into several distinct sections:

**Imports:** Necessary libraries are imported at the beginning.

**Data Loading:** The Excel file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

**Country and Hemisphere Definitions:** Lists of countries and their respective hemispheres are defined.

**Function Definitions:** Several functions are defined to extract months, determine fatality, and identify the hemisphere and season based on the month.

**Data Processing:** The DataFrame is processed to extract relevant information and categorize it.

**Data Grouping:** The processed data is grouped to count occurrences of months and seasons by hemisphere.

### Conclusion
The provided Python code effectively processes shark attack data to analyze the seasonal distribution of incidents based on geographical hemispheres. By utilizing functions for data extraction and categorization, the code prepares the dataset for further analysis and potential visualization. This approach not only enhances the understanding of shark attack patterns but also serves as a foundation for more complex analyses in the field of marine biology and public safety. Future enhancements could include visualizing the results using Matplotlib to provide a clearer representation of the findings.
