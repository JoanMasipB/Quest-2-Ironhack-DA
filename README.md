Analysis of Shark Attack Data by Season and Hemisphere
Introduction
The provided Python code is designed to analyze shark attack data from an Excel file, specifically focusing on the seasonal distribution of attacks based on the hemisphere and the fatality of the incidents. By employing the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, the code extracts relevant information from the dataset, categorizes it, and prepares it for further analysis.

Key Concepts
The code utilizes several key concepts in data analysis:

Data Extraction: The code reads data from an Excel file using Pandas.
Regular Expressions: It employs regular expressions to extract specific information from strings, such as months and fatality status.
Data Grouping: The code groups data by various categories (hemisphere, month, season) to facilitate analysis.
Data Visualization: Although not fully implemented in the provided code, the intention is to visualize the results using Matplotlib.
Code Structure
The code is structured into several distinct sections:

Imports: Necessary libraries are imported at the beginning.
Data Loading: The Excel file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Country and Hemisphere Definitions: Lists of countries and their respective hemispheres are defined.
Function Definitions: Several functions are defined to extract months, determine fatality, and identify the hemisphere and season based on the month.
Data Processing: The DataFrame is processed to extract relevant information and categorize it.
Data Grouping: The processed data is grouped to count occurrences of months and seasons by hemisphere.
Code Examples
Here are some key functions from the code, along with explanations:

Extract Month Function
language-python
 Copy code
def extract_month(date_str):
    # Extracts the month from a date string in various formats.
    ...
This function takes a date string as input and uses a regular expression to find and return the abbreviated month name. It handles various date formats and checks for valid month entries.

Determine Hemisphere Function
language-python
 Copy code
def determine_hemisphere(country):
    # Determines the hemisphere for a given country.
    ...
This function checks if the provided country belongs to the northern or southern hemisphere based on predefined lists. It returns the corresponding hemisphere or "Unknown" if the country is not found.

Find Season Function
language-python
 Copy code
def find_season(month, hemisphere):
    # Finds the season based on the month and hemisphere.
    ...
This function maps months to seasons depending on whether the hemisphere is northern or southern, returning the appropriate season name.

Data Processing
language-python
 Copy code
df["Month"] = df["Date"].apply(extract_month)
df['Hemisphere'] = df['Country'].apply(determine_hemisphere)
df['Season'] = df.apply(lambda row: find_season(row['Month'], row['Hemisphere']), axis=1)
In this section, the code applies the previously defined functions to the DataFrame to create new columns for month, hemisphere, and season. It also drops rows with missing values in these columns.

Conclusion
The provided Python code effectively processes shark attack data to analyze the seasonal distribution of incidents based on geographical hemispheres. By utilizing functions for data extraction and categorization, the code prepares the dataset for further analysis and potential visualization. This approach not only enhances the understanding of shark attack patterns but also serves as a foundation for more complex analyses in the field of marine biology and public safety. Future enhancements could include visualizing the results using Matplotlib to provide a clearer representation of the findings.
